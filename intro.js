/*
JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
